Let's take an example where we have three resources: 🌾**food**, 🪵**wood**, and 🪙**gold**. We can produce three types of units: 🗡️**swordsmen**, 🏹**bowmen**, and 🐎**horsemen**. 🐎Horsemen are **better than 🏹bowmen**, who are in turn **better than 🗡️swordsmen**.

But this \"guess and check\" solution **might not even be optimal**. Now imagine we have **millions of units and resources**: this greedy strategy is very likely to **completely miss the optimal solution**.

In this article, we're going to **find the best solution possible to this problem**. We'll use OR-Tools, a **powerful Python library** specialized in optimization. It will help us to **model this problem** in linear programming terms and **output an optimal solution**.

In exchange, we got **681 🛡️men-at-arms and 1 lost 🗡️swordsman** (welcome to them). The total cost of the army is **172,100**, which is **much higher** than the 111,300 we previously found (+65% increase) but it **truly is the optimal solution under these constraints**.

        "Optimization is often **neglected in favor of machine learning techniques**, but both have their merits: linear programming can produce an **optimal solution in an undetermined amount of time**, while machine learning can **approximate complex functions in no time**. There is no training in LP, but an **expert is required to build a mathematical model**. Machine learning needs data, but the models can be **used as black boxes** to solve a problem. As a rule of thumb, problems that **do not have a particular time constraint and/or are not extremely complex** can be advantageously solved with **linear programming**.\n",

        "In this article,\n",
        "\n",
        "* We learned about **interfaces for optimization**, and especially about Google **OR-Tools**;\n",
        "* We talked about **solvers and types of optimization problems**: LP, MIP, NLP;\n",
        "* We modeled and solved an **extremely common optimization problem** in an **optimal way** and **generalized our model** through a function;\n",
        "* We **reframed this problem** and merged two sets of constraints to obtain **the best army composition for the lowest price**.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a lot more problems where optimization can be applied: for instance, how to **create school timetables that satisfy everybody's requirements**? How to **deliver 1,000 different orders in a minimum amount of time**? Where to **create a new metro line to maximize its usefulness**? In future articles, we'll talk about **new types of applications** for these techniques, including satisfiability and nonlinear problems.\n",
